The site is now live, thanks to my new friends [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)! I am hosting on
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and aside from my domain name, this website
costs nothing to run in production, which is fantastic.

I initially started blogging on [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) around a year
ago, and- in just a few months, I accumulated over 10k views across my articles
and built up a few hundred followers.

My articles were featured in several weekly digests, and I was quickly gaining
momentum for someone still relatively new to the platform.

**Sounds amazing, right?**

Something I haven't talked about publicly is that I wasn't really enjoying the
content I was writing on Hashnode.

For me, it quickly became more about chasing the high of engagement rather than
putting out quality content.

The posts I was most proud of weren't successful engagement-wise, so I pivoted
my content to low-effort design pattern articles.

**When your hobby starts to feel like a job, something is wrong.**

After settling into my new job last year, I decided I wanted to get back to
writing, but I didn't want to fall back into old habits.

My philosophy towards posting on this site will differ from on Hashnode.

I can't guarantee that my content will regular or often, but it will be content
I am proud of.

**Until the next one!**
