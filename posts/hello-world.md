The site is now live, thanks to my new friends Next.js and Tailwind CSS! I am hosting on Netlify and aside from my domain name this website costs absolutely nothing to run in production, which is fantastic.

For those of you that know me, you'll know that I had a great experience blogging over on Hashnode in the first half of last year.

In just a few months I had accumulated over 10k views across my articles and built up a few hundred followers. My articles were featured in a number of weekly digests, and I was gaining a lot of momentum for someone still relatively new to the platform.

I stopped posting content from July last year due to time commitments but I vowed I would be back!

### Fresh platform, fresh outlook

After getting settled into my new job, I decided that I wanted to get back to writing, but I wanted to build my own platform to write on instead of relying on an existing one.

I maintain that as far as blogging platforms go, Hashnode is still one of the best for technical audiences, but I wanted the experience of building something from the ground up and adding features in as I go.

My philosophy towards posting on this site will be different to the one I had on Hashnode. I can't guarantee that I'll be posting on a regular or consistent schedule, but when I do it'll be content that I'm proud of.
